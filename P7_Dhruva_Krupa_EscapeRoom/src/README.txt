Title: Escape earth - Saving humanity

Opening story:
Earth is in great danger of complete being sucked into a blackhole. Prolonged battles between clans has depleted
much required technological and material resources for large scale escape from earth. In the true spirit of survival
and continuity, the great leaders have come together and pooled in their resources to build a rocket powerful enough
to go far and escape the inevitable destruction of earth and humanity.

The last hope of humanity to preserve and continue life lies in the hand of a rocket engineer to assemble a rocket
and blast off in time before the annihilation. Make sure you keep track of time. Time is the essence and time is
money. Use time judiciously and save us from extinction.

Game idea/flow:
This game is based on escape room theme. However, the game is time based and not turn based. You have limited time to
complete your mission. Since time is the most critical resource, you can trade time to purchase items needed to build
a rocket. Items that are hard to discover will have smaller value to purchase. Once you purchase, it value will increase
so that you can exchange the item for a different item that you need even more.

Overall, you make time by involving in reading, purchasing and exchanging. Most interactions leads to net positive gain.
Inactivity is expensive and you will eventually lose the game by running out of time.

Walk through:
[TBD] Since I am still evolving the game, I am yet to come up with all details.

You start with allocated time to complete the game. You will have some items scattered in the lab. You will have to
buy some items, grab some items and build up a reserve. You may not need some of the items, they can be used for barter.

There are some items that lose value after repeated use. This can impact when you try to barter. To favor the player,
remaining value after an exchange is added back as time with a multiplication factor. Hence, you will make more time
(and value) by indulging in trading.

Once you successfully assemble a rocket by combining the different parts, you are ready to leave Earth and preserve
life. Remember to blast off... You can still build a rocket and watch the destruction of earth and rest of humanity.

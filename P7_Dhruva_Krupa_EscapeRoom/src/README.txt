Title: Escape earth - Saving humanity

Opening story:
Earth is in great danger of complete being sucked into a blackhole. Prolonged battles between clans has depleted
much required technological and material resources for large scale escape from earth. In the true spirit of survival
and continuity, the great leaders have come together and pooled in their resources to build a rocket powerful enough
to go far and escape the inevitable destruction of earth and humanity.

The last hope of humanity to preserve and continue life lies in the hand of a rocket engineer to assemble a rocket
and blast off in time before the annihilation. Make sure you keep track of time. Time is the essence and time is
money. Use time judiciously and save us from extinction.

Game idea/flow:
This game is based on escape room theme. However, the game is time based and not turn based. You have limited time to
complete your mission. Since time is the most critical resource, you can trade time to purchase items needed to build
a rocket.

You use items and time to buy or exchange for rocket parts. Once you have all parts required to assemble a rocket, you
assemble a rocket and escape.

Walk through:

You start with allocated time to complete the game. You will have some items scattered in the lab. You will have to
buy some items, grab some items and build up a reserve. You may not need some of the items, they can be used for barter.

There are some items that lose value after repeated use. This can impact when you try to barter. To favor the player,
remaining value after an exchange is added back as time with a multiplication factor. Hence, you will make more time
(and value) by indulging in trading.

There are various opportunities to grab items by unlocking a toolbox. To make it more challenging, we have
different passwords that randomly rotate.

We have introduced a concept of leased items. You can lease certain items and can use them a fixed number of times.
After they are used, the item will have to be returned. The value you get by using the item will be more than the value
for leasing it.

Overall, you make time by involving in reading, purchasing and exchanging. Most interactions leads to net positive gain.
Inactivity is expensive since time is ticking and you will eventually lose the game by running out of time.

Once you have gained possession of all items to build a rocket, combine the items to assemble a rocket. You are ready
to leave Earth and preserve life. Remember to blast off... You can still build a rocket and watch the destruction of
earth and rest of humanity.

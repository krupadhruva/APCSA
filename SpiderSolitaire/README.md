### Purpose of the project
Semester 1 finals review: The project aims to build upon the various topics covered as part of semester 1 of APCS.

### How to start the project
The project contains a class named 'Driver' with a 'main' function. This is the entry
point to the spider solitaire game.

### User instructions

The game is implemented using text UI with user input read from console and output displayed
again on the console. When the game starts, it always starts with a new game of pre-defined
number of deck of cards and stacks. These can be changed in the code.

Once a game is started, the user can load a saved game. The file selection is implemented using
Java GUI based file picker. A game can be saved at any point and restored later to continue
the game.

### TODO

1. The game can be further extended to support 'undo' and 'redo'
2. Integrating the game with graphics based on 'gpdraw'
3. Detecting when the game reaches 'an impossible to win' state
